# File-Structure
In this mini project we have created one application which is easy to access and user friendly. 
For this application is developed using simple java code. The project title is “Indexing” which is used in the application and for distinguishing the type of file structure to be used. 
 
The work provides a simple and attractive and it creates the simple index and simplify the work as well as it reduces the time taken and t takes the same time to search the record in the first and also the record in the last. 
 
Indexing is a data structure technique to efficiently retrieve records from the files based on some attributes on which the indexing has been done. An index in which the entries are a key ordered liner list. Simple indexing can be useful when the entire index can be held in memory. 
 
Changes (additions and searching) require both the index and the data file to be changes. Updates affect the index if the key field is changed, or if the record is moved. An update which moves a record order is determined by the order in which they are entered. The physical order of records in the file may not be the dame as order of entry, because of record deletions and space reuse. 
The index should be read into memory when the data file is opened.
